# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction---Classification-Capstone-Project

**Project Description:**

This Capstone project focuses on predicting whether customers who have previously purchased health insurance will opt for vehicle insurance. The insurance company aims to target the same customers who have already shown interest in health insurance. By predicting their likelihood to opt for vehicle insurance, the company can optimize its communication strategy, enhance its business model, and increase revenue. The dataset used for this project consists of customer information, including gender, driving license possession, previous vehicle insurance status, response regarding vehicle insurance, vehicle damage information, the duration of association with the company, region of residence, and annual premium price.

**Business Context:**

Our client is an insurance company specializing in health insurance. They want to expand into vehicle insurance and need our help in predicting whether their past year's health insurance policyholders will be interested in their new vehicle insurance offering.

**Understanding Insurance:**

Insurance is a way to protect against potential losses, illnesses, or accidents. Customers pay a regular amount (premium) to the insurance company in exchange for coverage. For example, you pay an annual premium of Rs. 5000 for health insurance, and if you get sick, the insurance company covers your medical expenses up to Rs. 200,000. The company can afford this because not everyone gets sick every year. Only a few customers need the coverage, and everyone shares the risk.

**Predicting Interest in Vehicle Insurance:**

To succeed in this venture, we aim to predict whether a customer would be interested in their vehicle insurance. This prediction helps the company plan its communication strategy, reach out to potential customers, and optimize its business model and revenue.

**Data Description:**

We have data that includes customer demographics (gender, age, region code), vehicle information (vehicle age, damage), policy details (premium, sourcing channel), and more.
